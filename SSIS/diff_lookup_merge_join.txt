difference between using Merge Join  transform with Inner Join option and Lookup transform.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)if the source and lookup table doesn't have any duplicates in any table then there is no change in the results.

2)if the lookup table will have duplicate records in joining column then merge join will produce the output as inner join in sql.
but the lookup will elimate the duplicate values and display only one record which is inserted first in lookup table .

3)if  source table is having  duplicate data in joining column both lookup and mergejoin  (inner) results with duplicate data in target.

to perform the merge transform with left join function using lookup we need to select ignore failure option in lookup transform connection.
