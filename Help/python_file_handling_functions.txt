#To create a new file in Python, use the open() method, with one of the following parameters:
#"x" - Create - will create a file, returns an error if the file exist
#"a" - Append - will create a file if the specified file does not exist
#"w" - Write - will create a file if the specified file does not exist
import os

k = open("file1.txt","a") #create a file file1 if it is not exist.
k = open("file1.txt","r")  # read mode will read the data from file.
print(k.read())   #to display the file content as output

f = open("file.txt","r") # to open a file which is existing in a read mode
print(f.read())   # display the file contents.

# to read the first three letters in  a file
f = open("file.txt","r")
print(f.read(10))

print("my first line is")
f = open("file.txt","r")
print(f.readline())  # to read the first line use readline() method

print("for loop to read the file content line by line \n ")
f = open("file.txt","r")
for x in f:
    print(x)

# To delete a file, you must import the OS module, and run its os.remove() function:
print("file handling functions")
j = open("file2.txt","a")
print("file created and appending")
j.write("hello i am newly created file content")
j = open("file2.txt","r")
print(j.read())
#close the file which is in read mode before delete
j.close()
os.remove("file2.txt")
print("file2 is deleted")

# join() will add the delimeter  which we have mentioned after every character.
