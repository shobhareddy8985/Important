What is Change Data Capture?
Change data capture (CDC) is the process of capturing changes made at the data source and applying them throughout the enterprise. CDC minimizes the resources required for ETL ( extract, transform, load ) processes because it only deals with data changes. The goal of CDC is to ensure data synchronicity.

Inserting new records, updating one or more fields of existing records, deleting records are the types of changes which Change Data Capture processes must detect in the source system.

STEP 1: DB Set up
Source and Target Tables: I have a source table which has 6 records and an empty destination table.

We need to enable CDC on the entire Database by executing sys.sp_cdc_enable_db

To list all the databases that are CDC enabled we can use the below query:

SELECT name, database_id, is_cdc_enabled FROM sys.databases

WHERE is_cdc_enabled = 1


Checking the list of Databases  which are having Change Data Capture enabled .



USE master 
GO 
SELECT [name], database_id, is_cdc_enabled  
FROM sys.databases       
GO 

-- Disable Database for Change Data Capture template   
-- =======  
USE MyDB  
GO  
EXEC sys.sp_cdc_disable_db  
GO
